### Experience {#experience}

SLA Mobile Ltd

: *Vodafone : Deployment Automation Consulting - London, UK*
  __Jul 2013-current__
  [Vodafone Group][Vodafone Group] (VFG) are in the initial stages of a 10-year project to completely upgrade and 
  centralize [BSS] infrastructure for 14 EMEA carriers. <br/>
  I was engaged to build a proof-of-concept multi-domain/multi-carrier Continuous Delivery 
  pipeline using a mixture of pre-selected vendor and OSS tools. The objective of this project 
  is to validate technical feasibility and document risks in scaling CI/CD to the 
  planned 190+ production environments.<br/>
  `Automation, Chef, Jenkins, Vagrant, Maven, Artifactory, AWS EC2, HP Quality Centre, IBM Rational Team Concert, 
  MCollective, Ruby, BMC BladeLogic`

: *Alacrity : Lead Engineer - NZ*
  __Dec 2010-current__
  Vodafone Ireland wanted to leverage the Group [Click-to-Bill][[Vodafone CTB] service for 
  national merchants and aggregators. This is not practical for a number of reasons including prohibitive
  internal on-boarding costs and a merchant engagement and support processes geared towards large global entities, such as Google,
  RIM and Microsoft.<br/>
  SLA Mobile was engaged by Vodafone Ireland to provide a solution catering these local merchants and developers. Based on the customers 
  initial requirements, I developed and delivered a self-service developer portal and a set of billing and
  customer-care APIs. It took 4 months from initial customer engagement until the first production release. <br/>
  The initial product has grown to become [Alacrity][alacrity], SLA Mobile's [Direct Carrier Billing][dmb] SaaS solution marketed 
  to carriers world wide. Alacrity now supports a range of customer and merchant channels including the 
  REST APIs, desktop and mobile browser, and an in-app purchase support. <br/>
  Until late 2012 myself and a KL-based SI were the sole technical resources working on Alacrity. My responsibilities 
  also covered production support, product management, pre-sales support, and delivery of technical and non-technical documentation.<br/>
  Alacrity is now maintained by a small DevOps team of 5, including myself. We use CI/TDD, RSpec for 
  unit, functional and integration tests; Cucumber, Selenium and Vagrant for automated acceptance tests.
  We use campfire for team communication. [hubot] automates many tasks including application deployments.<br/>
  `Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Cucumber, Chef, Vagrant, Capistrano, Apache, nginx, Postgres, Mongodb, Memcache,
  AWS EC2, Ubuntu, Jenkins, Github, Gitlab, Campfire, Hubot, Trello, Code Climate, REST XML/JSON, New Relic, HTML,
  CSS2, LESS, Bootstrap`

: *Billing Adapter Upgrade : Systems Engineer - NZ/AU*
  __Dec 2012-Apr 2013__
  Vodafone Hutchison Australia required new billing adapters for their ER platform in order to support several 
  Vodafone Group [CTB][Vodafone CTB] propositions, including integration with [Google][Google DCB], Microsoft.<br/>
  In addition to the technical requirements and design documentation, I implemented the Java-based payment adapters, 
  supported UAT, and provided go-live and post-launch support together with the project SI and another Senior developer.<br/>
  TDD practices were followed for the Java development, with majority tests written using Rspec under JRuby. Final delivery
  consisted of about 1,100 tests for around 16k lines of Java adapter code.<br/>
  `Java, Spring, Hibernate, JPA, Oracle DB, JBoss, Solaris, JRuby, RSpec, RR, SOAP/REST, Eclipse, GIT`.  
  
: *Mondrian API : Architect / Developer - NZ/UK*
  __Mar 2010-Aug 2011__
  Mondrian is a set of Vodafone specific Web Services derived from [Parlay-X] whereby individual carriers can
  expose a consistent set of capabilities to the [Vodafone Group] Global Integration Gateway (GIG). By 2010 the 
  Mondrian V1 solutions implemented by many EMEA carriers were bespoke solutions offered by large vendors and 
  subject to lock-in through the use of proprietary technologies and closed black-box solutions.<br/>
  While working with the GIG development team in London I identified a commercial opportunity for SLA Mobile to
  to enter the Mondrian market with a product based primarily on OSS components and to use an OSS-style
  approach to product development between carriers.<br/>
  I wrote and presented the original business case, and addition to managing a small DevOps team, 
  looked after ESB configuration and customization (mostly lots of XSLT transformations), automated 
  infrastructure and application build/deployments, and implementing several of the Perl-based reference services. <br/>
  This project delivered a full "reference" implementation of the first generation Mondrian APIs based on OSS components.   
  `WSO2 ESB, Java, Spring, JBoss, Axis2, Perl, XSLT, SOAP, Maven, GIT, M4, Ruby`

: *Vodafone : Business Process Analyst - London/Düsseldorf*
  __2009__
  Consultant to Vodafone Group alongside the GIG development, QA and production teams based in Düsseldorf and London. I evaluated their
  development, release and support processes and wrote a detailed report highlighting inefficiencies in their current
  processes and provided specific recommendations that leading to improved product quality and reduced delivery times.

: *Vodafone : Presales Engineer - London UK*
  __2009__
  Technical pre-sales support for the UK sales team covering various EMEA-based projects. I was directly responsible for
  supporting the sales team, assisting on RFP responses, preparing technical prototypes and detailed design documentation 
  as required.

: *Fox Media : Mobile Portal Developer - NZ*
  __2008__
  International mobile content retailer [Jamba!] required a site to support their launch into the Asian markets (Indonesia primarily). 
  Jamba's internal development team was not able to deliver within the time-lines required by the business, so
  SLA Mobile was engaged to deliver mobile and web portals selling ringtones, wallpapers and related mobile
  content within 6 weeks.<br/> 
  I delivered the content management and mobile portal under the 6 weeks, and the KL team delivered a Java-based desktop web solution.<br/>
  The platform consisted of a rails based content management ingestion platform, and consumer facing portal for content discovery 
  and purchase. The solution consisted of the portal itself rendering device agnostic semantic markup, and 
  a transformation proxy responsible for device-specific content rendering.<br/> 
  Challenges in this project mostly stemmed from the diverse population of devices with simple, often buggy, browsers and limited
  media support. A lot of  effort went into content and delivery optimization while ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices. 
  It was successful enough that we later rebranded for Jamba to support Vodafone Qatar.<br/>
  `Ruby, Rails 2, Phusion Passenger, Postgres, XSLT, XML, WML 1/2, ImageMagick, WURFL, XHTML MP, HTML, CSS, CentOS, Capistrano.`

  Built an multi-environment configuration and application deployment solution based
  on Capistrano replacing the manual approach taken by most other Vodafone carriers.<br/>

  of several months until the role could be filled internally.<br>

Dear XXXXX,

Well, I have to admit it has been quite some time since I last wrote a cover letter, and I'd quite forgotten how it's
supposed to go. 

Fortunately Google has helped me out again, and told me I need to do two things: firstly, I must show you 
I can do the job that you need done, and secondly I must convince you that you'd actually want to work with me. 
Oh, and that I need to be subtle about the second point.

Addressing the first point: I am confident that I can do the work that XXXXX requires from a Senior Systems Engineer, and do a 
fantastic job of it. As you can see from the attached CV, while writing CVs is not my strong point, I have been 
building, running, and growing complex, high-availability systems similar to yours for quite some time. I still love it. 

Where I don't have knowledge of some of the specific technologies you use, I have used analogous systems (chef vs puppet, MySql
vs Postgres etc), and I am confident I can up-skill in specific technologies before starting. 

As to whether you would you want me on the team? Of course you would! I am friendly, honest, humble (believe it or not), 
and only very occasionally grumpy. While you'll just have to take my word for it until you meet me in person, if it helps 
I have been told by previous co-workers and employers that I'm one of the best that they've worked with - although I've
never repeated that outside of a cover letter :-) 

Why am I applying for this job? You are a customer focused business, based in New Zealand with a world class 
product, the team looks fantastic, the OSS-based technology stack is right up my alley, *and* you have a great coffee machine. 
Why wouldn't I? 

My inner geek loves building, optimizing, and automating stuff. Real job satisfaction comes from making a positive 
difference to peoples lives through my work. I get a real kick working with people who are smart and passionate about what they do,
and most of all, helping my others whenever I can. 

If you require more information 

Finally, to address some of the points in the job description itself that aren't obvious from my CV:

> ... have a good understanding of SQL performance and optimisation...

I have an understanding of database query optimisers, query plans, and various strategies to improve
both database and query performance. Carried out performance troubleshooting and optimisation on 
some large Oracle databases with tables of several hundred million rows.

> * Building, administering and monitoring the infrastructure that runs
>   XXX


> Are you cool with being on the on call roster? 

Yes. I am on an on-call roster in my current position, and I am used to working outside of normal business hours 
since I work mostly with people in other time zones.

> As a young child you had a predilection for pulling stuff apart to let all the magic smoke out of the appliances

Er, guilty.

> Likewise, you have a computer science degree or be clever enough to go and get one.

After working at a University, I'm not sure you have to be clever to have anything less than a PhD, but I do have a BCMS if that helps.

> Are you curious?

Why do you ask?

> Are you a systems thinker?

Yes, I believe I am. For example I have an aptitude for intuiting root causes of issues within complex computer environments 
arising from the interactions of the parts.

> Do you love automating shit like building and managing servers?

Hell yes! :-)
